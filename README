this is a collection of tools that i made to extract content from xbox releases of arx fatalis.

mostly motivated by finding an old alpha release of the game and noticing that some things in the levels look a bit different.
sadly the game is not working that well, so i wanted to extract the files so we can open them in an editor and take a look at them
